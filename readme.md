# Introduction
The discovery of biomarker sets for a targeted pathway is a challenging problem in biomedical medicine, which is computationally prohibited on classical algorithms due to the massive search space. Here, I present a quantum algorithm named Quant\textit{Ants} Machine to address the task. The proposed algorithm is a quantum analog of the classical Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We create the mixture of multi-domain from genetic networks by representation theory, enabling the search of biomarkers from the multi-modality of the human genome. Although the proposed model can be generalized, we investigate the \textit{RAS}-mutational activation in this work. To the end, Quant\textit{Ants} Machine discovers rarely-known biomarkers in clinical-associated domain for \textit{RAS}-activation pathway, including \textit{COL5A1}, \textit{COL5A2}, \textit{CCT5}, \textit{MTSS1} and \textit{NCAPD2}. Besides, the model also suggests several therapeutic-targets such as \textit{JUP}, \textit{CD9}, \textit{CD34} and \textit{CD74}.
