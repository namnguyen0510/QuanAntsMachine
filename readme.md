# Introduction
The discovery of biomarker sets for a targeted pathway is a challenging problem in biomedical medicine, which is computationally prohibited on classical algorithms due to the massive search space. Here, I present a quantum algorithm named Quant_Ants_ Machine to address the task. The proposed algorithm is a quantum analog of the classical Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We create the mixture of multi-domain from genetic networks by representation theory, enabling the search of biomarkers from the multi-modality of the human genome. Although the proposed model can be generalized, we investigate the _RAS_-mutational activation in this work. To the end, Quant_Ants_ Machine discovers rarely-known biomarkers in clinical-associated domain for _RAS_-activation pathway, including _COL5A1_, _COL5A2_, _CCT5_, _MTSS1_ and _NCAPD2_. Besides, the model also suggests several therapeutic-targets such as _JUP_, _CD9_, _CD34_ and _CD74_.
